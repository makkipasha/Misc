I am writing to formally raise a concern regarding the unprofessional behavior I have experienced from Sr. Director Krishna during our recent interactions.

From our very first call, he displayed an overly aggressive approach, pressuring me to complete a task immediately—despite the fact that I had only just received access to the console and had not yet had the opportunity to explore the system. As a senior leader, he should be aware that extracting information or executing tasks from the console requires familiarity and that demanding immediate results without prior context is unreasonable. His approach felt more like an attempt to grill me rather than a constructive discussion, creating unnecessary stress.

Furthermore, he has been repeatedly calling me without any prior scheduling, disrupting my workflow. Such unscheduled and persistent calls make it difficult to focus and set a very unstructured precedent for professional communication.

Additionally, I was shocked when he started insisting that I come to the office, despite the fact that my position is explicitly designated as remote. One of the main reasons I opted for this role was because of its remote nature, and forcing me to come to the office goes against the agreed-upon terms of my employment.

Beyond professional boundaries, he also engaged in inappropriate personal questioning, asking where I live, about my parents, and why I take care of my daughter alone. My personal life and family matters are none of his business, and such inquiries are highly unprofessional and intrusive. A workplace should respect boundaries, and such personal questions have no place in a professional setting.

Given these concerns, I respectfully request HR’s intervention to ensure a more professional and respectful working relationship moving forward. I would appreciate a discussion with you and any relevant stakeholders to address this matter appropriately.
